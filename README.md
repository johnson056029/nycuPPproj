#Introduction



StochHMM is a free, open source C++ Library and application that implements HMM
from simple text files.   It implements traditional HMM algorithms in addition it
providing additional flexibility.  The additional flexibility is achieved by
allowing researchers to integrate additional data sources and application into
the HMM framework.
 
For documentation on model syntax and designing a model, see Github wiki.

##Integrating Data
Here are a few of the ways that StochHMM allows the users to integrate additional
data sources:
 1. Multiple Emission States
 2. Weighting or Explicitly Defining State paths on a sequence
 3. Linking States Emissions/Transitions to external user-defined functions
 
 
##Multiple Emission States
 
StochHMM allows the user to provide multiple sequences.   These sequences are then
handled by the emissions.  These sequences can be REAL numbers or discrete characters/words.
StochHMM allows each state to have many emissions (Discrete or Continuous).  Discrete emissions
can be independent of each other or joint distributions.   The continuous emissions
can be considered in multiple ways.   1)  They can be considered as raw probabilities which 
will be integrated without transformation.  2) They can be considered as values to be plugged
into a Univariate Probability Distribution Function or Multivariate PDF (In the case of multiple
REAL sequences.
 
Each states emissions are user-defined, so one state may have emissions from two
different sequences, while another may only have a single emission from a single sequence.
 
##Weighting or Explicitly Defining State paths to follow on a sequence.
 
Often, we have some prior knowledge about the sequence.   If this is the case,
we may want to integrate that into the model, without redesigning or retraining the model (a timely endeavor).
StochHMM allows the user to explicitly define a State path (By name of state, or category of state).
In addition, StochHMM also allows the user to weight a states path (By name of State or category of state defined by user)
This allows the user to restrict the predicted path or weight their prior knowledge.
 
 
##Linking States Emissions or Transitions to external user-defined functions
 
When that transition/emission is evaluated the function is called and can provide an emission. While 
this may provide one way of addressing a weakness of HMMs, which is that they do not handle long
range dependencies.  We see it rather as a way to link together existing utilities or functions that 
provide additional information to the decoding algorithms.   In this way, we can link divergent 
datasets or functions within the HMM trellis in order to arrive at a better prediction.
